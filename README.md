## Project Description

This is a **frontend clone of the official React.dev website** built using **React** and **Bootstrap**.  
The MVP showcases **UI/UX skills, component structure, and React routing**, replicating the official site's look and feel.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive **navbar** with **React logo** and **search bar**

- **Hero section** with spinning React logo  
- Interactive **cards** in Home section  
- **Sticky Docs sidebar** for navigation  
- Footer with links

## Limitations
- **Frontend only**: No backend or database integration yet  
- **Search bar**: UI only, functionality not implemented  
- Tutorial, Blog, Community pages contain **static content**  
- No user authentication

## Future Roadmap
- Add **backend (Node.js/Express)** to serve dynamic content  
- Integrate **database (MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL)** for tutorials, blogs, community posts

- Add **authentication** for community features  
- Make website fully **dynamic and full-stack**
